//Create a function called reverse () that takes two parameters. The first parameter, called str is a pointer to a string that will be reversed upon return from the function. The second parameter is called count, and it specifies how many characters of str to reverse. Give count a default value that, when present, tells reverse () to reverse the entire string.
